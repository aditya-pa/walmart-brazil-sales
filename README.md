# walmart-brazil-sales
This project investigates Walmart Brazilâ€™s sales decline using a Kaggle e-commerce dataset. Data is cleaned in Python, loaded into SQL Server (SSMS), and used to train an ML model to predict delivery delays. Three Power BI dashboards (Sales, Customer Reviews, Logistics) visualize trends and operational issues, aiming for a 10% sales increase.
